The hope is that this page gives you the ingredients to build your own patterns, though it takes a lot of technique to string things together so that they work as a whole! Learning every pattern on this page would get you nowhere on your own.

If something's marked with a *, I didn't know the proper name so I made one up.

Sugar push </br>

Whip </br>

 </br> Almost all West Coast Swing moves are a variation of these basic patterns. You should think of these patterns as 2-count-long elements, which are the essential ingredients sandwiched between the '1&2' and the anchor. The example links given below aren't necessarily the patterns themselves, but just the elements that make it that pattern. The 'Texas Tommy' example below is a Texas Tommy with an unwinding spin into a wrap into a go-around, but the element that makes it a whip is the Texas Tommy. </P>

Texas Tommy: From handshake hold, bring your hand down so that as she anchors at the end of the slot, her arm is behind her back. Lots of angular momentum coming out of this.

Apache whip </br>

Face-down-the-slot whip*: Instead of turning toward the follow for the anchor, switch hands as they pass and continue facing forward and counter their weigh

Windows whip: Starting in cross-hand hold, create the second anchor without letting go. Standard is to exit this with a two-hand outside turn. </br>

Tuck lead turns too:
